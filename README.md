NodeFTPD
========

NodeFTPD is an FTP server written for Node.js. It's currently in **alpha** and is not recommended for use in any environments. 

The project is a Node.js/JavaScript learning project, but I intend on making it into a feature complete FTP server that I can deploy on my own servers.
